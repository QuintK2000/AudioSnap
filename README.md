The detection of audio similarity is a fundamental problem in music information retrieval,
with applications in content-based music retrieval, plagiarism detection, and music
recommendation systems. This project proposes a method for audio similarity detection
using MinHashLSHForest, a probabilistic data structure that allows for efficient and
scalable nearest neighbor search. The proposed method involves pre-processing the
audio files, resizing them to have the same length, generating audio fingerprints using
MinHash, and indexing them with MinHashLSHForest. The effectiveness of the
proposed method was evaluated using two audio files, and the results showed that it
was able to accurately detect similar audio files with a high degree of precision and
recall.

Overall, this paper demonstrates the potential of MinHashLSHForest for audio
similarity detection and highlights its relevance in the field of music information retrieval.
